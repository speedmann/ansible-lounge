# Ansible role for The Lounge

Ansible role to install [The Lounge](https://thelounge.github.io/), a self-hosted web IRC
client.

What this role does:

- Installs [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) to run The Lounge in the background
- Installs [NodeSource's Node.js 4.x LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)
- Installs [The Lounge v2.7.1](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- Creates a system user to own the `lounge` process
- Configures The Lounge [as a private server](https://theloungegithub.io/docs/server/configuration.html#public) to enable user login
- Configures users as defined in your playbook variables, each with logging support
- Starts The Lounge server as a [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) program

Note that this playbook will also install
[esprima](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esprima) and
[jsonlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonlint) npm packages to check syntax
of configuration files.

## Requirements

This role should be compatible with Ansible 1.9 or higher.

It was written for Debian and Ubuntu distributions.

## Role variables

### `lounge_debug`

Sets debug mode for available keys (`irc_framework` and `raw`).

All keys of this variable default to `false`.

#### Example

```yaml
lounge_debug:
  irc_framework: true
  raw: true
```

### `lounge_port`

Sets the port that `lounge` is listening on.

This variable defaults to `9000`.

### `lounge_prefetch`

Enables or disables link and image prefetching for clients of this instance.

This variable defaults to `false` (change it to `true` for a better experience).

### `lounge_reverse_proxy`

Sets whether the server is behind a reverse proxy and should honor the
`X-Forwarded-For` header or not.

This variable defaults to `false` (change it to `true`Â if The Lounge is running
Nginx, etc.).

### `lounge_theme`

Sets the visual style to apply to The Lounge, among those offered with the
software.

This variable defaults to `example`.

#### Example

```yaml
# Options are: crypto, example (default), morning, zenburn
lounge_theme: morning
```

### `lounge_users`

Lists all users allowed to access The Lounge using their credentials.

By default, no users are created.

**Warning:** At the moment, user configuration files are only created if they do
not exist, so changing passwords does not get reflected when provisioning. Use
the web interface (since v1.3.0) or the `thelounge reset` command to change
passwords.

#### Example

```yaml
lounge_users:
  - user: WiZ
    hashed_password: $2a$04$g8xA7UYVGXwtMp1fJIyINerlXjzieA/lva9O3rUWV2KEpLTjhdVD6 # "password"
  - ...
```

Passwords are hashed using [`bcrypt`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt). To
generate a password using the [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
npm package, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install bcryptjs
 node node_modules/bcryptjs/bin/bcrypt "my password"
```

(Note that the `bcrypt` command is prefixed with a whitespace to
[not be saved in your `bash` history](http://askubuntu.com/a/15929/166928),
if configured accordingly).

### `lounge_version`

Installs a specific version of The Lounge. It must be one of [the official
releases](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/releases).

This variable defaults to the stable version mentioned at the top of this
document.

#### Example

```yaml
lounge_version: "2.0.0-pre.1"
```

## Example playbook

Go to the [test playbook](tests/test.yml) to see an example playbook using this
role.

## Development environment

Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) using your favorite package manager
and run:

```bash
vagrant up
```

This will spin up a minimal virtual machine and provision it with a test
playbook using that role.

If that step succeeds, syntax of the role is correct and all tasks are
successful on a bare machine. It does not test the specifics of the role
however, that you need to check yourself by connecting to the VM:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

To provision the virtual machine again, run the following:

```bash
vagrant up # Unnecessary if the VM is already running
vagrant provision
```

You should then be able to access The Lounge at <http://localhost:9000/>, and
connect with the following test credentials:
  - Username: **WiZ**
  - Password: **password**

You can also run the tests against the VM with:

```bash
./tests/tests.sh
```

Lastly, once you are done with changes, you can run one of the following:

```bash
vagrant halt -f # Shuts down the VM for later re-use
vagrant destroy -f # Destroys the VM entirely
```

This role is
[backed by Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/astorije/ansible-lounge).
It uses the same test playbook to ensure that, for every push:

- Syntax is correct
- The role and playbook run fine
- The role is idempotent (running it twice in a row results in un-changed states
  only)
